on fixing errors for part 2 I didnt have any errors other than adding more commits

For the poe I added new functionalities 
firstly Added a functionality that will calculate the avarage price of the menu items but broken down 
into different course and added avarage price of the whole menu 

secondly moved the adding of menu items on a another screen whereby the chef will still be able to add 
and remove the menu items from the added menu and the menu that is on the homepage and also made sure that
they are saved in arrays

Lastly added a filter where by you can choose which specific course you want choose from
